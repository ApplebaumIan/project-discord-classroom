# Version Control
● GitHub will be used as the version control system for Discord Classroom.<br/>
● Branch protection will be utilized to not allow any pushes directly to the main branch. This ensures that the main branch will always be a deployable codebase and safe from any errors that could cause it to break. <br/>
● Each task will have a different branch for a group member to work on. A naming scheme that is consistent and uses the Jira ticket system will be used.<br/>
● Code reviews will be done by other members to verify any changes and to sort out any merge conflicts after a task is completed and before it is merged with the main branch.<br/>
● Branches will be kept up-to-date and to avoid any merge conflicts will be merged with the main branch on a consistent basis.
