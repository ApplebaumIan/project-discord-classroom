# Acceptance test

Use Case Acceptance Test will be performed to ensure that certain features are functional and work for the user's needs.

### Add bot to the server

Actions: Open Discord and make a new Classroom server, then navigate to the bot’s github page and add the bot to the server. 

Expected Result: The bot is added to the new classroom server and will populate the server with the various channels and helpful functions and features.

### Create Roles 

Actions: Type ‘/’ and select the roles option. Then enter the number(s) for the section(s) needed. Next click on a role to see that it adds that to their discord profile which can be checked by clicking on the users profile.

Expected Results: The Bot adds the roles into the roles channel and the user is able to select a role and see that it changes their profile in the server.

### Attendance

Actions: Type ‘/’ and select attendance and add a message to create a poll to be able to prompt students to check in for the class.

Expected Results: The Bot will start the check-in for attendance and will state the poll the user chose to show and record who marks that they have attended class for the day.

### Poll

Actions: Type ‘/’ and select poll and add the options desired for the poll if the educator wants to ask if students are following or just to prompt a multiple choice question to make sure everyone is following the lesson.

Expected Results: The Bot will launch the poll, students will respond and the educator will get a better understanding of where to go with the lesson.

### Private Question

Actions: In the Public Questions Channel type ‘/’ and select private. Then add the question that is to be asked to the Educator/TA.

Expected Results: The Bot will delete what the user has typed and will star a private channel for just the user and Educator/TA for them to discuss the question privately.

### Class Ping

Actions: Type ‘/’ and select announcement and add the message you would like to share with everyone, such as an answer to a problem brought up in a private chat that the Educator would like everyone to know about.

Expected Results: The Bot publishes the message in the Announcement channel and pings everyone so that they get a notification.
