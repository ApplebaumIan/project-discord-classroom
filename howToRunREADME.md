# How to Run Discord Classroom Bot

1) You will need to first create the Discord Server that you would like to use as a Classroom ([for help](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-)).
2) Next you will need to invite the Bot with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1069136471635800164&permissions=8&scope=bot) to join the classroom you have created.
3) Enter the server and you can now type ‘/’ and select help or type ‘/help’ to get more information on the Bot.
4) You can follow along with the Acceptance Test ([Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7M14jydYnNDTcZuedH4e5BVZQyFxsuZoQAXXERoXSY/edit?usp=sharing)).
